# Consortium Remote Sprint

_2021, February 9-10_

_This will be a private event aimed to improve collaboration among the Consortium partners._
_If you are interested in participate to a scikit-learn development sprint a number of public Sprints are
[scheduled](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/wiki/Upcoming-events)._

## Before the Sprint
- Create your [github account](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) 
if you don't have one already.
- **Set up your development environment** following the instructions:
  - [1.environment.md](https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/RemoteSprintJune2020/blob/master/1.environment.md)
  - [2.building.md](https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/RemoteSprintJune2020/blob/master/2.building.md)
- **Get familiar with the scikit-learn development process**
  - [3.example.md](https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/RemoteSprintJune2020/blob/master/3.example.md)
  - [4.test.md](https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/RemoteSprintJune2020/blob/master/4.test.md)
  - [5.workflow.md](https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/RemoteSprintJune2020/blob/master/5.workflow.md)
  - [6.ci.md](https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/RemoteSprintJune2020/blob/master/6.ci.md)
  - [7.documentation.md](https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/RemoteSprintJune2020/blob/master/7.documentation.md)
- Have a look a the resources linked below.
- You can ask for help on the [Gitter Sprint Channel](https://gitter.im/scikit-learn/sprint), at any time.

## During the Sprint

The sprint will take place on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) (see the invite link sent by email).
Discord text and audio channels will be used for communication during the Sprint.

A list of addressable issues is available [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/RemoteInterpretabilityFebruary2021/projects/1).

Feel free to join an audio room to discuss specific topics in small groups and advertise the top in the main text channel.
It is possible to share the screen in audio channels and therefore possible to engage in pair programming sessions.

If you want to use the audio feature of the Discord app, it is recommended to manually adjust the "Input sensitivity" level in the "App Settings"
to avoid having your speech cut in the middle of a sentence.
